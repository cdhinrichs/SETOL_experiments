# SETOL_experiments
Experiments for the Semi-Empirical Theory of Learning

## Installation
This package uses [[https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/][rye]] to set up the python environment. To install rye, 
run this command from a terminal:
```
curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash
```
Once rye is installed, then run
```
rye sync
```
to set up the python environment. This will also install jupyter lab for running the notebooks.

Once that step is completed, then do,
```
cd pytorch/saved_models/SETOL/MNIST
unzip SETOL_experiments.zip
```
which will unpack the saved experimental results file.


## Generating the plots
The plots in the paper are generated by the notebooks in the notebooks folder. If the above commands have been run 
successfully, and if the `pytorch` directory is in the `$PYTHONPATH` when running the jupyter lab, then the notebooks 
should be able to generate all of the plots.
